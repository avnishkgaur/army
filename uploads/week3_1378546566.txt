This week we started working on our project. We are working under a large project of Built-in Testing Equipments. I went across many employees here at ground level to understand their process system, and during one of these trips, I realized that most of the disassembly part is not required. That is, only if the employees here could check beforehand whether the assembly is faulty or not, it would save them at least 3 weeks, which is considerably huge considering total time of overhauling is around 144 days. So, I started working on creating BITE (Built-in Test Equipment) for testing GCE (Gun Control Equipment). So far, I have been able to access some internal manuals about it and get in contact with all the experienced people in the workshop who has done some work on these lines in the past. I have started doing research on this topic, and with the help of fellow employees here, by next week I will get all the stuff required for this project here.
