The first day of first week went very quick. Colonel was not aware of our internship dates, so he told us to look around and gave us a mini demo of what to expect in near days. The second day was more fruitful with an offical orientation and meeting with the representatives of Army Base 505. We were told to go through the workshop (which itself consists of many workshops), and to understand their working methodology and to choose a project with large scope. They also suggested some key projects which seemed interesting, but maybe we will understand them better after going through in detail with them. Later, on fourth day, we were called for a meeting with brigadier to express our interests and key areas. I listed down embedded systems, robotics and they told me Gun Control System could be of interest for me. Meanwhile, we are going through various workshops understanding the basic working methodology of tank Overhauling Process right now. Since there is a dedicated workshop for even small components, it took us some time to go through in detail with it. By the end of this week, we had a much stronger understanding of tanks and other army equipments than anyone else.
