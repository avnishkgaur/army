The first week mostly went through understanding their work culture and going through various workshops. Army Base 505 Workshop focuses on R4 level of repair, which makes it the single workshop in India to do that for tanks, and other military vehicles. We learned about their process cycle. We understood about the basic concepts of overhauling Tank T-72 and Tank T-90. Apart from these tanks, Army Base also focuses on Tatra and another form of military bridge support vehicle. This week we went through the ground level of working here. We assessed the possibilities of projects here. There are many luricative options ranging from Moving Target Detection to BITE systems. I am discussing each option in detail with our project supervisor and the feasibility and value addition of it to the system.
